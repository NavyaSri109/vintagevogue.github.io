                    1. Product Authenticity
                       - All items sold on Vintage Vogue are pre-owned vintage or thrifted pieces. We strive to provide accurate descriptions and photos, but slight variations in color and condition may occur.<br>
                    
                    2. Returns and Exchanges
                       - Due to the unique nature of our products, all sales are final. We do not accept returns or exchanges unless an item has been significantly misrepresented. If you believe an item was misrepresented, please contact us within 48 hours of receiving your order.<br>
                    
                    3. Shipping
                       - We offer standard and expedited shipping options. Shipping times may vary based on location and chosen method. Please note that international shipping may incur additional customs fees or delays, which are the responsibility of the buyer.<br>
                    
                    4. Payment
                       - All payments must be made through our secure checkout process. We accept major credit cards and PayPal. Payment must be completed before items are shipped.<br>
                    
                    5. Privacy Policy
                       - Your personal information is kept confidential and is used solely for processing your order. We do not share your details with third parties, except as necessary to fulfill your order (e.g., shipping carriers).<br>
                    
                    6. Order Cancellations
                       - Orders can be canceled within 24 hours of placement. After this period, cancellations are not permitted as we begin processing your order immediately.<br>
